# Cards_Swipe

- **Overview:**
  - This project demonstrates a simple iOS app for swiping through custom card views.
  - It uses the `ZLSwipeableView` library for swipe functionality.

- **Main Components:**
  - `ViewController`:
    - Manages the swipeable card views.
    - Uses an array of `SwipeCellModel` objects to populate card views.
    - Implements next and previous card navigation.
  - `CustomView`:
    - Represents the custom card view displayed in the swipeable stack.
    - Contains UI elements like buttons and labels.
    - Conforms to the `CustomViewProtocol` for button actions.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Users can swipe left and right to navigate through card views.
  - The custom card view (`CustomView`) includes "Previous" and "Next" buttons for navigation.

- **CustomViewProtocol:**
  - Defines a protocol for handling button actions in `CustomView`.
  - `didTapNextButton()` and `didTapPreviousButton()` methods are called when buttons are pressed.

- **Layout and Styling:**
  - Card views have rounded corners and drop shadows for a polished appearance.
  - The layout is set up with Auto Layout constraints.

- **XIB Loading (Optional):**
  - The code allows loading card views from XIB files if specified (`loadCardsFromXib` flag).
  - XIB files contain the layout and design of the card views.

- **GitHub Repository:**
  - The project code can be found in this GitHub repository.
